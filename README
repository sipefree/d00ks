RUNNING
	Navigate to the d00ks directory and run the following command:
	$ python parser.py

	There is a basic ARM program in there that will compile and run.
	You can modify the program etc etc.

	program.debug() starts a simple debugging REPL. Currently the
	only working command is 's' for step. Breakpoints are coming soon.

	This is started automatically by running parser.py
